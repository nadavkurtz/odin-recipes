        <p>Similar to spanakorizo, a Greek spinach and rice dish, this easy, meatless meal features orzo, spinach, peas and scallions. It is deeply satisfying but still on the lighter side of pasta recipes, thanks to all those vegetables. A little feta gives it creaminess and tang, while some lemon zest brightens everything up. It makes a complete meal on its own, or, if you’re looking for something more substantial, serve this as a hearty side dish to roasted meats or fish.</p>
        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 large scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>8 ounces baby spinach leaves (8 cups), coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1¾cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock</li> 
            <li>1cup orzo</li>
            <li>1teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (from 1 lemon)</li>
            <li>¾cup crumbled feta (3 ounces), plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>½cup frozen peas, thawed (optional)</li>
            <li>1cup chopped fresh dill, or use parsley or cilantro</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong> Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium, then melt butter, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir in about three-quarters of the scallions (saving some of the green parts for garnish) and garlic, and cook until softened, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong> Stir in spinach, adding in batches if it doesn’t all fit in the pan at once, and ½ teaspoon salt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
                Stir in stock and bring to a simmer. Stir in orzo, lemon zest and remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until orzo is nearly cooked through and most of the liquid is absorbed, 10 to 14 minutes, stirring once or twice.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
                Stir in cheese, peas (if you like) and dill, cover the pan, and cook for another 1 minute, to finish cooking and warm the peas. To serve, sprinkle with more cheese and the reserved scallions.</li>
        </ol>
