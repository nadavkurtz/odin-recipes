# odin-recipes

Some things I learned from this:

1. How to publish directly from Github
2. Test it first locally because I had issues with the links to the recipe pages being broken
3. If you have this issue, try purging caches because that was why old URL paths weren't being updated
4. Use the Message Editor under Source Control for now. Adding commit messages through VIM got confusing
5. Relative paths do not need repo directory (i.e. odin-recipes)
