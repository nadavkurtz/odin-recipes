        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> The creamy sumac sauce served with these burgers is fantastically sharp and will go well with most non-red meats (chicken sofrito, for example) and also with grilled vegetables and fritters. You can make it in advance, or double the quantity, and keep it refrigerated. After a day the flavours will mellow so you may want to reinvigorate it by adding extra sumac and lemon juice. The burgers are very portable. You can have them as a snack from the fridge and they are also ideal for taking over to friends or in a lunchbox for work.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500 mg minced turkey</li>
            <li>1 large courgette, coarsely grated (about 200g in total)</li>
            <li>40g	spring onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 medium free-range egg</li>
            <li>2 tbsp	chopped mint</li>
            <li>2 tbsp	chopped coriander</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>First make the soured cream sauce by placing all the ingredients in a small bowl. Stir well and set aside or chill until needed.</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 220ºC/200ºC Fan/Gas Mark 7. In a large bowl mix together all the ingredients for the meatballs, bar the sunflower oil. Once evenly mixed, shape into burgers, about 45g each, making about 18.</li>
        <li>Pour enough sunflower oil into a large frying pan so you get a thin layer at the bottom, about 2mm thick. Heat up well and sear the meatballs in batches on medium heat from all sides. Cook them for about 4 minutes, adding oil as needed, until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the seared meatballs into an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper and place in the oven 5-7 minutes, or until just cooked through. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
